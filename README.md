Before We Begin: About the Patch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an unofficial, minimally maintaind verion of Psh.  It exists because 
I like to use Rafael Corvalan's ldapsh LDAP editor on new systems.  It works
to the extent that the funcitonality needed by ldapsh seems to be correct so
far, but beyond that, I can make no promises.  I can only say that it includes 
very few changes, all of which are made to make the newer Perl interpreters 
happy with this library.

The original README follows, but note that much of the information on where to 
find the code is entirely out of date.

The Perl Shell (psh)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
WHAT IT IS:

The Perl Shell (psh) combines aspects of bash and other shells with the power
of Perl scripting. It aspires to be your primary login shell.


WHERE IT CAME FROM:

Numerous times when developing Perl code, the author wished for an interactive
Perl execution environment in which to try out code snippets. After some
looking around, there didn't appear to be a handy solution that acted enough
like a shell to be satisfactory. It all might have ended (or rather not bugun)
here except that while discussing the idea at lunch with his friend Denny Dahl
the pressure finally became too much to bear. That evening, version 0.001 of
the Perl Shell was born.

Initially Perl Shell development was privately hosted, with low-tech manual
mailing lists. Soon, however, that became too unwieldy and so the project
was moved to Source Forge (http://www.sourceforge.net/). Source Forge provides
a CVS repository, a release archive, mailing list management and more.


WHO WROTE IT

The original version was written by Gregor N. Purdy, but now there have been
numerous contributors, and much of the more advanced functionality was
actually implemented by members of the Perl Shell Core Team (see the file
psh.pod, or the manpage for psh if you've installed the Perl Shell for more
information).


WHERE TO GET IT

The official project home page is:

    http://www.focusresearch.com/gregor/psh/index.html 

The Source Forge main page for the project is:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=475


HOW TO USE IT

Download it from one of the locations listed above, and follow the instructions
in the INSTALL file. If you want to keep tabs on or participate in development,
then join Source Forge and sign up for mailing list memberships. Use anonymous
CVS access to keep an up-to-date copy of the code on your system. Become a
core developer to get CVS write access.
