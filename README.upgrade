This file contains the most important things to know if you're upgrading
from an earlier version. For a more complete listing of changes, please
see CHANGES.pod

Upgrading from version 0.009 or earlier:

- New redirection handling!
  We switched to rc-like syntax instead of sh-like syntax.
  "foo 2> bar" does not work anymore - use
  "foo >[2] bar" instead.

- There's no comment strategy anymore. A line starting with # will now
  already be ignored by the parser, so comments are mandatory.

- The variables @Psh::mon and @Psh::wday were removed - please use
  Psh::Locale::months() and Psh::Locale::weekdays() instead.

- Do not use %Psh::text directly - instead use Psh::Locale::get_text and
  Psh::Locale::set_text

- The config variables
  @Psh::executable_no_expand,
  $Psh::executable_expand_arguments,
  $Psh::prompt,
  $Psh::prompt_cont,
  $Psh::history_length,
  $Psh::handle_segfault,
  $Psh::save_history,
  $Psh::echo,
  were removed. Please use the new option builtin.

- %Psh::strategy_which, %Psh::strategy_eval, @Psh::strategies,
  @Psh::unparsed_strategies do not exist anymore.
  Please use the strategy builtin.
