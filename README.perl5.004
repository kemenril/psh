File::Spec
----------

psh has been tested on many different platforms but in order to remain as
platform independent as possible it is necessary to use the File::Spec
module.  This allows us to abstract away from any particular system's
directory/file separation.

Unfortunately perl 5.004 does not come with this module but it will work if
you take the File::Spec module out of the 5.005 distribution and use it.

If you are not able to install this in a system-wide directory you can
install it locally and run psh in the following manner:

perl -I/home/huggie/psh/lib -I/home/huggie/.perllibs /home/huggie/psh/psh

Where /home/huggie is my home directory, the first -I is for the psh libs,
and the second points to the directory you installed FFile::Spec in.

Missing regular expressions in 5.004
------------------------------------

Perl 5.004 misses several important types of regular expressions. So far,
features needing these regexps are simply disabled in Psh. The single
most important feature which is missing is probably the ability to escape
white space in e.g. filenames through backslashes. Anybody's welcome
to change this in Psh::PerlEval and Psh::OS::_escape()
